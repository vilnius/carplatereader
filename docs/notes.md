# Notes

## Meeting at Susisiekimo Paslaugos

* Only the Police, not municipality can fine bad drivers on A lanes, but laws are being introduced
to Seimas to change that; that may happen only after a year or more. Police is already overwhelmed
with speeding camera tickets, so extra load is not welcome. A lot of manual work at police, could
be improved.
* Police, VAD, Vilnius Airport, etc. have each separate camera networks. There are attempts to
integrate all of them into a single system. Not going well.
* It is already planned to put a stationary camera somewhere as a pilot project that would stream video. Povilas/we could get access to this stream and use it to test our ideas, make MVP.
* There are around 600 buses, ~50 cameras inside, ~50 facing outside. No Internet connection
inside buses, all data stored inside memory cards, used only when there are accidents/crimes.

## New ideas
* Citizens can subscribe and get SMS notifications when their bus(es) are being late (Alfredas)
* Reverse engineer, open-source m.ticket and parking client and server-side applications (ArtÅ«ras)
